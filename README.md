# Frontend Mentor - Challenge 1

## Product preview card component

First challenge I have developed from frontendmentor.io. This challenge was very basic, but I have reviewed and I have learned knowledge that I had never put into practice, as it was my first time coding. 

#### I have applied grids, flexboxes and responsiveness.
